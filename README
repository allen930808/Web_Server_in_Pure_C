# Project: Web_Server_in_Pure_C

## I just wanna write some code during vacation.
## So I just google C project recommendation, and a Youtube video pops out,
## "I made a web server In C like a true sigma"
## And I thought it'd cool and impressive if I build one on my own and I also want learn some internet stuff.
